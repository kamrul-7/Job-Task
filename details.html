      <h3 style="color: brown; margin-left: 40px">Overview of The Problem:</h3>
      <p style="margin: 40px">
        The fact that our designer goods do not represent wealth for positive
        utility is having more negative damage to society than we can fathom.
        This article is going to help detail why, and detail our solution in
        progress. As individuals, once we cover our basic needs, status becomes
        an intrinsic motivator in the rest of our actions. Status comes in many
        forms. The healthiest / most enlightened cultures put the highest status
        in rewarding positive sum behavior. In global culture, luxury goods like
        a Gucci bag/belt have become widespread as top status symbols,
        reflecting vapid use of money as the highest form of status. It has
        become such common Christmas list item for broke young teenagers that
        the richest man on the planet at the time of this writing got his riches
        from selling these overpriced goods representing nothing more than the
        ability to waste money. Collectively this misrepresentation of true
        status (service to others) is attributing more damage to building a
        healthy positive culture than we can imagine. Social media, our emergent
        global cultural production system, could be used collectively to unify
        humanity around bettering ourselves and others. Instead it is used to
        further extract youth through a false form of status as a service.
        Imagine a world where this wasteful spending was considered cancelable.
        One where we collectively take accountability for the capability to
        money to the positive growth of us as a species. Imagine a world where
        the designer things we wore showed off spending a lot of money to make a
        lot of positive impact. If the world you imagined only went as far as to
        redistribute the wealth of designer wear, try imagining the deeper
        cultural effects this new alignment would have.

        “Over the past hundred years we have increase the global GDP sevenfold,
        yet wealth inequality continues to skyrocket and luxury spending grows
        rapidly. In order to change the failure of redistribution of wealth at
        scale, we must effectively influence culture and help redefine what
        “status” is in the modern age. This will ultimately change the flow of
        money in society as the new age of status being helping the world,
        becomes more prominent. We have failed at building a society which
        healthily distributes wealth/power. Given society is a collective
        project we are responsible for, we think this stems from the culture not
        supporting doing good as the highest form of status. We have more than
        enough resources, but many people without access to them, and a culture
        that motivates and glorifies overspending on vanity luxury goods.” -

      <p style="margin: 40px">
        On a fundamental level once someone gets the basics covered as in food,
        water, shelter. They can start to spend their time and money on
        convenience, health, and purpose but more often than not; status is
        where a majority of surplus wealth goes. Societally we lack an alignment
        of our status symbols with creating a better world and with bettering
        ourselves. This idea to change what we cultural see as status has been
        referred to as “Status Engineering”. What we wear is the most direct way
        we have to represent ourselves and our ideals/values. What your role
        model wears, or any person of influence is shaping the idea of status in
        that child, teenager, or adults mind. Status is what we are buying when
        we pay $1, $10, or even $500 extra for a certain brand of T-Shirt
        irrespective of comfort. The problem is not that buying status is a
        failure mode of an individual. Status is a form of positive competitive
        drive in society and a tool for respect attribution. That’s why you see
        Dior shoes in economy. This is not a miscalculation, currently the
        status from spending $1100 on shoes does have more long term value than
        things like first class because we are playing the game of unenlightened
        capitalism. The problem is that we support the status symbol which costs
        $1100 and does no good for humanity. Thus this expenditure is not a
        failure of the buyer who bought status, it is only misguided that we do
        not have designer shoes that cost $1100, which builds a literal house in
        Bangladesh (a small home can be built as a permanent structure for
        someone for this amount). We need higher forms of status to exist in
        order to progress our culture which will aid in the distribution of
        wealth and power on a systemic level. Once higher status objects are
        unveiled will these purely financial status seems become recognized for
        their tackiness and buying status will coincide with doing good. With no
        better alternative currently, we idolize symbols of wealth. Thus, on our
        highest display of who we are, the clothing we wear, we display 0
        creativity or care for the world in spending and instead promote wasting
        wealth for the sake of power/leverage over others, and then we wonder
        why society is misaligned to building a healthy world. Fashion, what we
        wear, is the biggest signal we have in representing our identity and
        values. If we can provide a better representation of status in clothing
        we can not only change the money used to buy status into doing good for
        the world, but we can change our core representation of status in
        society towards doing good. While the larger belief is that this
        systemic change is the real impact in realigning our culture towards
        true status, the amount of funds in status spending that could be
        redirected towards positive causes is also no joke. The personal luxury
        goods market is projected to grow from USD 257.26 billion in 2020 to USD
        352.84 billion in 2027 The Luxury Cars Market size is expected to grow
        from USD 449.7 Billion in 2019 to USD 655.0 Billion by 2027; It is
        estimated to grow at a CAGR of 9.3% from 2020 to 2027. Aligning status
        culturally on a global scale means reattributing that wealth towards
        benefit for humanity and shifting the entire global view of wealth.
