        <p class="title-text">
          As individuals, once we cover our basic needs, status becomes an
          intrinsic motivator in the rest of our actions. Status comes in many
          forms. The healthiest / most enlightened cultures put the highest
          status in rewarding positive sum behavior. In global culture, luxury
          goods like a Gucci bag/belt have become widespread as top status
          symbols, reflecting vapid use of money as the highest form of status.
          It has become such common Christmas list item for broke young
          teenagers that the richest man on the planet at the time of this
          writing got his riches from selling these overpriced goods
          representing nothing more than the ability to waste money.
          Collectively this misrepresentation of true status (service to others)
          is attributing more damage to building a healthy positive culture than
          we can imagine.

          Social media, our emergent global cultural production system, could be
          used collectively to unify humanity around bettering ourselves and
          others. Instead it is used to further extract youth through a false
          form of status as a service. Imagine a world where this wasteful
          spending was considered cancelable. One where we collectively take
          accountability for the capability to money to the positive growth of
          us as a species. Imagine a world where the designer things we wore
          showed off spending a lot of money to make a lot of positive impact.
          If the world you imagined only went as far as to redistribute the
          wealth of designer wear, try imagining the deeper cultural effects
          this new alignment would have.

          On a fundamental level once someone gets the basics covered as in
          food, water, shelter. They can start to spend their time and money on
          convenience, health, and purpose but more often than not; status is
          where a majority of surplus wealth goes. Societally we lack an
          alignment of our status symbols with creating a better world and with
          bettering ourselves. This idea to change what we cultural see as
          status has been referred to as “Status Engineering”.

          The problem is that we support the status symbol which costs $1100 and
          does no good for humanity. Thus this expenditure is not a failure of
          the buyer who bought status, it is only misguided that we do not have
          designer shoes that cost $1100, which builds a literal house in
          Bangladesh (a small home can be built as a permanent structure for
          someone for this amount). We need higher forms of status to exist in
          order to progress our culture which will aid in the distribution of
          wealth and power on a systemic level.

          Once higher status objects are unveiled will these purely financial
          status seems become recognized for their tackiness and buying status
          will coincide with doing good. With no better alternative currently,
          we idolize symbols of wealth. Thus, on our highest display of who we
          are, the clothing we wear, we display 0 creativity or care for the
          world in spending and instead promote wasting wealth for the sake of
          power/leverage over others, and then we wonder why society is
          misaligned to building a healthy world. Fashion, what we wear, is the
          biggest signal we have in representing our identity and values.s

          Thought experiments make it obvious that this idea is memetic, and
          just has not been tried in the market. Once one initial company opens
          up this model, many more will follow and copy: For the same price as a
          Louie Vuitton bag, a permanent shelter can be built in Bangladesh for
          a family in need. This gives rise to the idea that anytime someone
          walks into a designer store and purchased an item, they are having to
          burn down a house (most making this decision unknowingly).

          Based on the principle “if a penny saved is a penny earned” we can
          extrapolate that to a Louie bag is a home burned. But just telling
          someone not to flex is not going to solve the problem. If we really
          want to win this war, we just need to sell higher status, for the same
          price.

          Protests outside of stores that sell meat where stands are set up
          showing customers videos of the harmed animals may not be a great way
          to connect with the target audience, and often cause a greater divide
          in mindsets. In this case volunteers or employees could stand outside
          of luxury goods markets, sporting the aligned luxury merch. Rodeo
          drive for example is a notorious spot where every designer store not
          only has a shop, but theres a steady flow of customers.

          Ultimately, the more projects that promote this new line of thinking,
          the more people think others think this way, the more status will
          align culturally with its true nature. Watching others do good for the
          world has always given us more hope for humanity. We believe the
          flippening of status has the potential to solve the worlds greatest

          It wasn't until our culture defined cigarettes as bad that we quit
          them. They are just as addicting. They become negative status symbols.
          Hopefully showing the power status has on human behavior. If you

          status is above even that.
